## Features

## Installation

## Developer

As a developer who constantly seeks to improve my development skills, my goal with Zentinel.TS is to create a powerful yet intuitive backend boilerplate that simplifies the development process for fellow developers. I aim to provide a toolset that makes backend operations more efficient and enjoyable, ensuring that developers can focus on building great applications without getting bogged down by repetitive tasks.

I envision Zentinel.TS as a go-to boilerplate for developers who appreciate the structure and convenience of Laravel but prefer to work within the Node.js ecosystem. By combining the best aspects of both worlds, I hope to foster a community where developers can share their experiences, contribute to the project's growth, and continuously improve their craft. Ultimately, Zentinel.TS will empower developers to create scalable, secure, and high-performance applications with ease, making backend development more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
